# Telco_Comm-DAEProject
Practice Exercise for Power BI using data on customer churn rate of Telco service provider.

### Introduction
This exercise focuses on providing tailored dashboards designed for a variety of audiences. The report includes four dashboards created specifically for executives, analysts, information workers, and the general audience.

The objective of this analysis is to understand customer churnâ€”what factors may be influencing it, the patterns that signal potential churn, and how these insights can guide decision-making to design effective interventions.

The industry context for this analysis is telecommunications/retail services, where customer retention is a critical measure of long-term success.

Understanding churn is important because it reveals what customers are looking for, highlights areas where expectations are not being met, and explains why some customers may feel leaving is more beneficial than staying. These insights allow businesses to anticipate challenges, strengthen customer relationships, and make data-driven decisions that improve retention.
